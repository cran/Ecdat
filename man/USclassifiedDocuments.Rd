\description{
  Data on classification activity of the United States government.  
  
  Fitzpatrick (2013) notes that the dramatic jump in derivative classification activity (\code{DerivClassActivity}) that occurred in 2009 coincided with "New guidance issued to include electronic environment".  Apart from the jump in 2009, the \code{DerivClassActivity} tended to increase by roughly 12 percent per year (with a standard deviation of the increase in the natural logarithm of \code{DerivClassActivity} of 0.18).

\usage{
data(USclassifiedDocuments)
}
\format{A dataframe containing :
  \describe{
    \item{year}{
      the calendar year 
    }
    \item{OCAuthority}{
      Number of people in the government designated as Original Classification Authorities for the indicated \code{year}.  
    }
    \item{OCActivity}{
      Original classification activity for the indicated year:  These are the number of documents created with an original classification, i.e., so designated by an official Original Classification Authority.  
    }
    \item{TenYearDeclass}{
      Percent of \code{OCActivity} covered by the 10 year declassification rules.  
    }
    \item{DerivClassActivity}{
      Derivative classification activity for the indicated year:  
      These are the number of documents created that claim another 
      document as the authority for classification.  
    }
  }    
}
\details{
  The lag 1 autocorrrelation of the first difference of the 
  logarithms of \code{DerivClassActivity} through 2008 is 
  \code{-0.52}.  However, because there are only 13 numbers 
  (12 differences), this negative correlation is not statistically 
  significant.
