\description{
  Read the list of representatives in the United States House of
  Representatives.

\usage{
readUShouse(url.="http://house.gov/representatives/",
   nonvoting=c('American Samoa', 'District of Columbia',
               'Guam', 'Northern Mariana Islands', 'Puerto Rico',
               'Virgin Islands'),
   fixNonStandard=subNonStandardNames, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{url.}{
    Universal resource locator to be read and processed to obtain the
    desired list
  }
  \item{nonvoting}{
    Character vector of the names of US territories that send a
    nonvoting delegate to the US House.
  }
  \item{fixNonStandard}{
    function to look for and repair nonstandard names such as names
    containing characters with accent marks that are sometimes mangled
    by different software.  Use \code{\link{identity}} if this is not
    desired.
  }
  \item{\dots}{ optional arguments passed to \code{fixNonStandard}}
}
\details{
  1.  \code{House.gov <- readHTMLTable(url)}.  As of April 2013, this is
  a list of 80 tables.  The first 56 are for the 50 states and 6
  territories.  The remaining 24 are for the first letter of the last
  name of the representatives.

  2.  Use \code{\link{rbind}} to collapse these into 2 tables.  The
  first has the district as a number without identifying the state
  (because that was with the names of the first 56 tables in
  House.gov).  The second has the state names but with the district
  numbers in a form not easily parsed.

  3.  Obtain the state names from the second table to match the names of
  the representatives in the first.

  4.  Add a \code{nonvoting} column for those "States" in
  \code{nonvoting}.

  5.  Look for and fix \code{surname} and \code{givenName} with
  nonstandard characters using \code{fixNonStandard}.
